# Teachable Camera Dashboard Serve

This is a simple NGINX Proxy that is designed to be run as a Docker Container. It build on the standard NGINX Docker image. It is configured to provide 2 functions:
- Serve the static Web App generated in the [dashboard](../dashboard/README.md) folder. The Dockerfile copies the `build` directory to `/usr/share/nginx/html` inside the container, which is where NGINX expects static files by default. These are served on port 80
- Proxy the object detection image generated by the Detect program. Flask serves this image at: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/video_feed.jpg`  and NGINX proxies it to `/video_feed.jpg` on port 80

The Web App being served can be accessed by browsing to the IP address for the Coral Board.
